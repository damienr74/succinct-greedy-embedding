Implementation of all data structures used to construct a greedy
embedding in the hyperbolic plane using the dyadic tree metric space.

For more details, see the paper: 
[Succinct Greedy Geometric Routing Using Hyperbolic Geometry](/paper/Succinct%20Greedy%20Geometric%20Routing%20Using%20Hyperbolic%20Geometry.pdf),
included in the repo.

- `lib/...` includes the data structures
- `test/...` includes the tests to make sure the code (somewhat) works :P
- `paper/...` includes the original paper that explains how to implement this.
- `benchmark/...` will include the performance measurements when they are implemented.
